Thanks for checking this project out! You can do whatever you want with it, even use it for commerical projects, just don't sell it, ok? Also, do not hold us liable for anything if you're using it. It's free, you're getting what you paid for.

If you’re looking for a free (“free” as in “air”) template to slap up while you get ready to launch your next project, look no further. A friend of mine and I recently slapped together a template for you – and your friends – to download.

Here are some things to know about this template:

- It’s totally free. You can use it for commercial purposes. Yes, you can remove our names from the footer (if you must).
- It’s MailChimp-ready! MailChimp is an incredible email service that you can use to collect email addresses from people interested in your new project.
- NOTE: The template comes with *MY* MailChimp form built in to it. You must change it to YOUR OWN account, otherwise I’ll collect all of your users and that won’t be fun for anyone. My form is included for testing purposes.
- It has a video background that works in most browsers but not all. For any browser that does not support it, the background defaults to an image. You can find awesome free stock videos on http://xstockvideos.com
- The template uses Twitter Bootstrap to help make it awesome and responsive. It should look great on any sized screen.
- The template comes with a demo message up on top. It’s super easy to remove, so don’t worry.
- The template only has one image – the background image. Anything else you see that looks funky is either a Google Font or Font Awesome.

Enjoy it, share it, put it to good use. Let me know in the comments below if you have any issues with it. I hope to blog about each component of the template in the near future (no promises).
